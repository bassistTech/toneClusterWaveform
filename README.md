## How and why did you get here?

You probably got here here because I shared a link to this repo. Why did I do this to you? Maybe because:

* You're interested in learning how PC based audio analysis works.
	[Here's the notebook, it might take some time for GitHub to render it](https://github.com/bassistTech/toneClusterWaveform/blob/master/Tone%20cluster%20audio%20waveform.ipynb)
* You want to use the tone cluster waveform file without building it from scratch
	[Here's the file](https://github.com/bassistTech/toneClusterWaveform/blob/master/tonez44100.mp3)
* You want to build or modify the file
	Clone the entire repo to your computer and have fun!

## Requirements

* For reading the notebook, just patience and basic high school math
* For using the waveform file, a computer or device that can play an audio file
* For using or changing the code, a working Python 3 environment, and familiarity with running a Python program within that environment
